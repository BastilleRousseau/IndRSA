\title{Extract individual coefficients}
\usage{
ind_coef(m = 1, mod_ls, cutoff = 0, id_year = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{model number (based on number in list of formula provided to rsf_ind)}

\item{mod_ls}{A list of list of model generated by rsf_ind}

\item{cutoff}{A cutoff value to exclude individuals with bad fit, default = -1 indicating model that did not converge will be excluded. Values > 0 will exclude based on coefficient}

\item{id_year}{Whether id_year (instead of individual) are provided. Individual and year needs to be separated by an underscore for the function to work properly.}
}
\value{
A table of individual coefficients
}
\description{
Extract individual coefficients.
